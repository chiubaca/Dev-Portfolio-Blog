# Controlling my Anxiety

Status: Work In progress

I developed anxiety in 2020 and here are things that have helped me control it better.

# Progress Muscle Relaxation

Or PMR for short. This is a process of tensing and then releasing each of muscle groups in term. By focusing on the sensation of tensing and releasing can actually relax the mind. The process is very simple. Start from the top of your body and work down. With each exercise, really focus on the sensation the tesning and relaxaing is having on the mucle group you are working on

1. Raise your eye brows as high as you can and hold for 5 seconds. Then release and relax for 15 seconds.
2. Lock your jaw for 5 seconds. Then release and relax for 15 seconds.
3. Raise your shoulders as if you are trying touch your ears with your shoulders, hold for 5 seconds. then relax for 15 seconds,
4. Place your hands on your waist, then push your chest forward brining your shoulder blades close together and hold for 5 seconds. Then relax for 15 seconds
5. Makes fist and hold
6. Tense your abs
7. Tense your quads
8. curls your toes

# Traditional Chinese Medicine

Now I need to place a big disclaimer on this. This should not replace conventional care. I spoke to my GP about this and they approved of my trying it for short term if it helps me.

TCM herbal stores are getting very popular and should be able to find your local one with a quick internet search.  I'm sure experiences may vary, but I had a very patient and warming practioner called Dr Zhang. We had a 45 mind consultancy and asked all sorts of questions around my parents background and all the symptons that i had been feeling. After the consultancy she prescribed me a weeks worth of herbal tea which cost me Â£49.
