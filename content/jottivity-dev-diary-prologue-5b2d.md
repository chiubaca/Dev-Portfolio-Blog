This is the start of a personal experiment. I'm committing to an on-going series of quick blogs which  will document my progress building a web application from the ground up, shipping it and hopefully monetising it. 

This is part of my on going efforts to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/). I'm going to be sharing my successes, failures and lessons learnt as I go with no filters.

# What am I building?

I'm building a journaling app and habit tracker which will analyse your mood using sentiment analysis and potentially other techniques. I'm calling the app Jottivity.

I've already built a proof-of-concept (POC), but I'm re-writing it from scratch with additional features and hopefully with a more maintainable codebase.

The main features for the minimal-viable-product (MVP) will be:

- Mood Analysis based on your journal entry
- Interactive chart for mood analysis
- Offline support
- Optional email/push notification reminders
- Fun and simple UI/UX
- Dark mode

# What are my goals?

1) Learn about building and shipping a product to market
2) MVP by Christmas 2020
3) Launch on Product Hunt
4) Monetise
